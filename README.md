# Shawn_coup_game

I got inspired to create a python version of this lovely game. Just want to improve my python skill. No commercial usage is allowable.
Till now 100% written by myself.

Please download coup.py and run in python to play with your friends. Version after 3.6 is required since the dictionary needs to have order according to the input.

For my coding logic and potential improvements please check the notebook.
